The Odin Project - Javascript/jQuery project
Learning how to make a grid, add classes, and so much more. 

Project wrap notes:
I do wish I had figured out how to add borders. It was simple for the first two types of square, but for the opacity-changing one, in order to keep the border I would have had to use a much more complex way of changing opacity. This was so simple and clean, I decided to remove the borders completely and leave a blank canvas. 

I also didn't bother to make the buttons look pretty. Time to move on and learn Ruby!
